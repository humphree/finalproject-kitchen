						<h2>Testimonials</h2>
						<p>&quot;When we began thinking about our kitchen renovation, we did not know where to begin in regards to the design and layout.  With 4 small children, we wanted an eat-in kitchen with plenty of usable storage space and a consistent operational flow with the necessary appliances.  The team at Transitions not only developed the perfect design, but the finished product was more beautiful than we every imagined it could be ... and they were fast!  Thanks, Transitions&quot;.<br />
